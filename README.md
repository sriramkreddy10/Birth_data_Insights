### For Baby Care and Product Industries:
The Baby care and saftey products companies can adjust their marketing based on the months where more babies are being concieved. Here as we can see in the months of August, September and October more number of babies are delivered, so the companies can increase their marketing about baby products during these months.

### For Contaceptive Industry
In genaral Pregnancy lasts for about 280 days or 40 weeks that is around 9 months. So for instance the condom companies should try to increase their marketing 9-10 months before the months which have more number of births. Though we may require more data to deduce something like this like number of pregnencies, number of abortions, number of misscarriages and so on, this insights are based on the data we are currently using.
